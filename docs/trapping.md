* [TNR Handbook from Neighborhood Cats](files/Community-Resources-for-Pet-Owners.pdf)    

* Withhold food for a couple of days - just a couple, nothing extreme. The cats need to be just hungry enough to ignore the instincts telling them not to go into the trap.
* Don’t put the trap out in the open. Try to put it next to a building, under a bush - make it blend in as best you can. 
* Make sure the trap is level and flat on the ground. You don’t want it to move when the cat steps into it. 
* Cover the trap. You can make trap covers, but a sheet or towel will do. 
* Use the best, smelliest food you can. Tuna, sardines, and KFC extra crispy (really!) are used by professional trappers.


## Drop Trapping
* If you have a cat who will not go into a trap, consider using a drop trap.

### Ants
* Put the food dish in a flat pan/dish of water to keep ants out.

### Bed Bugs
* Wash and dry all linens on high heat, especially anything that has been to the shelter, like trap covers.
