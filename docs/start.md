## Tips for finding lost cats:
* Make sure to post to [Lost and Found Pets, Philadelphia - Powered by ACCT Philly](https://www.facebook.com/LostAndFoundPhilly)
* [How to find a lost cat video by Front Street Animal Shelter](https://www.facebook.com/FrontStreetAnimalShelter/posts/2045642912167821)
* Helpful tip - put a box with some soiled litter from your cat’s litter box outside. If your cat is having trouble finding its way home, it will be able to smell this from a long distance. Keep an eye on it to make sure you’re not attracting any unwanted guests. 

# WILDLIFE
*  **Never** attempt to feed wildlife. Always handle wildlife with gloves, or you may be putting it at risk for euthanasia, as well as putting yourself at risk for disease.
* Contact the following wildlife centers for advice or to surrender wildlife in distress.
