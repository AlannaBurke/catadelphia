#LOST CATS
## Lost / Found cat posts are permitted in all the hyperlocal facebook cat groups like: 
* South Philly TNR
* NE Philly AdvoCATS
* West Philly Cats

## Tips for finding lost cats:
* Make sure to post to [Lost and Found Pets, Philadelphia - Powered by ACCT Philly](https://www.facebook.com/LostAndFoundPhilly)
* [How to find a lost cat video by Front Street Animal Shelter](https://www.facebook.com/FrontStreetAnimalShelter/posts/2045642912167821)
* Helpful tip - put a box with some soiled litter from your cat’s litter box outside. If your cat is having trouble finding its way home, it will be able to smell this from a long distance. Keep an eye on it to make sure you’re not attracting any unwanted guests. 

# WILDLIFE
*  **Never** attempt to feed wildlife. Always handle wildlife with gloves, or you may be putting it at risk for euthanasia, as well as putting yourself at risk for disease.
* Contact the following wildlife centers for advice or to surrender wildlife in distress.

# I FOUND A CAT: WHAT DO I DO?
* Assess the cat’s condition. Is it in immediate danger? If it’s injured, sick, starving, dehydrated, or otherwise unlikely to survive outside, catch the cat. Do whatever you can do to get it off the street immediately. If you have to put it in your basement, garage, porch, whatever, it’s better than where it was, and you can improve its situation drastically.
* Take the weather into account. Frail cats will be at a higher risk in very cold or very hot temperatures.
* If the cat is friendly, your work will be easier.
* If the cat is feral, you’ll need to trap it. 
* Check all cats for an ear tip - this will tell you if they’ve already been TNR’d. 
* If the cat appears pregnant, make a clinic appointment immediately. Pregnant cats need to be spayed. Also, pyometra is a uterine infection which can kill cats if left untreated and can make cats look pregnant. If the cat looks at all possibly pregnant, prioritize their spay.

* Place a box with a blanket inside nearby and place food & water near that. If mama is still around she will move the kittens inside the box for safety and not having to travel for food means mom and kittens remain safe until you can either find a rescue for the family or it’s safe for kittens to be weaned and mama TNR’d.
* Assess the kitten’s condition. If you are at all unsure, get it into the hands of an experienced rescuer immediately. Dehydration can kill a young kitten very quickly. 
* Keep the kitten warm with a heating pad or hot water bottle under a blanket - not too hot! You can also microwave a sock full of rice and put it next to the kitten to snuggle up against. 
* Do NOT feed the kitten cow’s milk or anything other than Kitten Milk Replacer. You can get this at Walmart and most grocery stores, 24 hours a day.
